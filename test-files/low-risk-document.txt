Software Development Proposal
=============================

Project: AI Assistant Integration
Client: TechCorp Industries
Date: March 18, 2024

Objective:
Create a custom AI assistant that can help automate customer service responses and improve user experience.

Technical Requirements:
1. Write code that integrates with existing CRM system
2. Create functions for natural language processing
3. Generate automated responses based on customer queries
